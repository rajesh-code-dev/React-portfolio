        <p >Hello! I'm Rajesh, a Front End Web Developer based in Noida, India who enjoys building stuff with JavaScript and React. I develop fast, responsive and accessible websites/web apps which perform well on all devices.
          My love for coding started After July 2022, when i started learning about web development. Since then i have used any means at my disposal to get better at what i do. I have used various resources like Udemy, Youtube, FreeCodeCamp, Reddit, Documentations, Books etc to learn about web development. Sometimes i did feel like this was something that i couldn't do but overcoming these challenges was a very fun and rewarding experience for me. I have enjoyed every single minute of my coding journey so far and i want to keep improving myself.</p>
